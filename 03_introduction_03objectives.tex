\subsection{Objectives}

This study focused on developing a more lightweight YOLOv3 model while preserving a comparable level of accuracy to the standard model. It aimed to achieve this by implementing various optimizations to enhance computational efficiency. The study explored three specific techniques: depthwise separable convolutions, filter pruning, and attention blocks. Model variants were employed to identify the combination that yields the best performance. Additionally, the study evaluated the effectiveness of combining depthwise separable convolutions and attention blocks, as well as assessed the impact of filter pruning on the models. The parameter count of the model variants were compared and analyzed, while also considering their ability to address real-world challenges in public spaces.
