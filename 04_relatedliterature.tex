% \section{Review of Related Literature}

Efficiently addressing the challenge of pedestrian detection in surveillance is a critical concern, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of model development. This section provides an exploration of pertinent literature, beginning with an overview of the YOLO model in Section \ref{yolo}. Section \ref{pedestrian} focuses on models developed for pedestrian detection. Defining and comparing efficiency, along with an analysis of various YOLO model variants is discusses in Section \ref{efficient}. Lastly, subsection \ref{efficient_ex} examines studies that developed efficient models.
