\subsection{Research Questions}
The study seeks to answer the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{How does the optimized YOLOv3 model compare with the baseline YOLOv3 model in terms of performance?} \\
    The study would like to observe if the level of accuracy will be maintained or decreased, as well as its differences in mAP. It will also be compared in terms of detection speed and inference time. \newline
    \item \textbf{How does the combination of depthwise separable convolutions and attention blocks affect the computational cost and efficiency of YOLOv3?} \\
    This study aims to identify the parameter count required for the proposed model, and compare it to the standard YOLOv3 model. The study would also seek to identify if the particular approach created a notable reduction to the size of the model while maintaining a similar level of performance. \newline
    \item \textbf{By how much improvement would be acceptable for comparability to the baseline model through the addition of filter pruning?} \\
    The study seeks to evaluate the impact of performing filter pruning to the baseline model. Additionally, the study may also find insights on how this method affect the model's ability to detect certain features or objects.
