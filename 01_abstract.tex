% FROM SEAN
% Hi guys heads up for those using the discs latex format from migs. The margins doesn't conform to the OADGP standard which was pointed out by the style reader.

% Issues are:
% 1. Page number should start after the first page.
% 2. Bottom margin and right margin should be 1 inch
% 3. New Chapter margin should be 2 inches
% 4. Left margin should be 1 1/2 inches
% 5. Bleeding of text outside the margin in the paragraph or sentence

% When you export from latex, the margin spaces becomes smaller, so try to increase it more.
