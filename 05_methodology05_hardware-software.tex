\section{Software Implementation}
Training and testing of the YOLOv3 model and testing were conducted using the PyTorch library and the Python programming language. PyTorch is a free and open-sourced machine learning framework used for various machine learning applications such as image processing and natural language processing applications \cite{WhatPyTorch}.

\subsection{Hardware Implementation}
The models were trained on an Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU, with an Intel Core i7-8750H Processor and 16 GB of RAM.
